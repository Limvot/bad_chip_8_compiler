The Bad Chip-8 Compiler

I made this to demonstrate how a higher-level language could be compiled down into asm as a teaching exercise.
I'm a bit worried it might be too hard to read to get the point accross, but we'll see.
I am it to be a very basic langauge with C-like syntax.

Done:

    * functions, calling functions, parameters
    * inline asm

To Do:

    * local variables
    * assignment
    * if
    * while

Non-Goals:

    * pointers - chip-8's I register is so wacky
